Here's some really bad code to make some really bad music using the zocdoc search page.

Made with <3 at whatever hackathon the June 2019 one was.

# how to oontz
1. Open up [zocdoc.com](https://zocdoc.com)
2. Do a search
3. Wait for timesgrid to load
4. Open up the dev console (ctrl-option-j)
5. Copy and paste this into the prompt and hit enter. I swear its not sketchy at all :)
```
let s=document.createElement("script");s.type="text/javascript",s.src="https://cc-hackathon-oontz.s3.amazonaws.com/oontz.js?v="+parseInt(99999999*Math.random()),document.head.appendChild(s);
```
6. Hit the `~` (its next to the 1 key) to start and stop the "music". Clicking anything will also stop it.
7. Enjoy
8. Hit me up with the good beats. I'm a huge fan of the Upper East Side Cardiologists.
